# 🌍 World Economic Development Analysis using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **global economic indicators** and applies **Machine Learning** techniques to classify countries based on their **development level**.  
It converts raw economic data into meaningful insights useful for economic research, policy analysis, and data-driven decision making.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a machine learning model that can **predict a country's development category** using key economic indicators such as income, education, life expectancy, and HDI.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Techniques
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting / AdaBoost  

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains multiple **world economic indicators**, including:
- GDP per capita  
- Income index  
- Education index  
- Life expectancy  
- Human Development Index (HDI)  
- Other macro-economic features  

**Format:** CSV  
**Scope:** Multiple countries across the world
